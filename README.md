## GROUP PROJECT ABSTRACT

We as Group 3 picked the topic of the control and management of Big Data and selected three readings based on this, Danah Boyd and Kate Crawford's "Critical Questions for Big Data", Stephen Roberton's The Differences between the Digital Humanities and Digital History", and Alan Liu's "Against the Cultural Singularity"
and also tied everything with Nan Z. Da's article "The Digital Humanities Debacle" in the end.  Each portion of our presentation/interpretation of the readings can be summarized in three parts:  Problem, Context, Solution.  Overall, we attempted to make our presentation and examples we used as applicable to real world situations as possible to allow the audience to relate better to the main general themes of the presentation.

## INDIVIDUAL PROJECT ABSTRACT

I wanted to explore the intersection between Data Science, the social science discipline of Anthropology, and further indications in humanities like History, as a crucial example of Digital Humanities at play, within the specific application of using online admixture calculators using genetic data of different modern ethnic population groups or ancient samples from neolithic archaeological cultures.  I wanted to establish a link between results of breaking down the ancestry of modern Tai-Kadai populations in China by components created by forming direct comparisons with ancient samples belonging to different archaeological cultures through the calculator and popular hypotheses of the origins and dispersal of the Tai-Kadai language family from the leading historical linguists of the field.  The conclusions that were generated were that the genetic breakdown of Tai-Kadai populations throughout China correlated with two archaeological cultures, the Xitoucun culture representing Proto-Austronesian speakers, and Vietnam Bronze Age representing Proto-Austro-Asiatic speakers, which gives credence to Laurent Sagart and Roger Blench's theory Tai-Kadai languages emerged from the contact and interaction between the Austro-Asiatic and Austronesian language families in coastal Southern China.  This statement alone has ramifications in understanding culture and applications of culture of these people groups.
